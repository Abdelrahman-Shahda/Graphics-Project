This repository contains the Project for Team A8 using OpenGL with C++17. It is made for the "Computer Graphics and Man-Machine Interfacing" course (CMPN205) at Cairo University Faculty of Engineering.

**IMPORTANT:**

> While running, make sure that the working directory is the project directory and not the build folder.
> This is necessary since the code expects to run in the same directory where the "assets" folder exist.
